# Observer Design Pattern
This repository accompanies the article on [A Brief Introduction to Observer Pattern](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/observer-pattern-a-brief-introduction-cb733a13c87f), providing insights into the Observer design pattern, its applications, and a practical code example. The main focus is on understanding the concept and implementing it in the context of a simple web page, specifically a profile page in an application.

## Overview
The Observer pattern is a powerful software design pattern where an object, known as the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers. The subject automatically notifies observers of any state changes, typically by invoking one of their methods. This pattern establishes a one-to-many dependency relationship, making it ideal for scenarios with numerous components dependent on specific events.

## Use Case - Profile Page
The practical demonstration involves the creation of a simple web page, representing the profile page of an application. Users can load an image on this page, and upon successful loading, the image is displayed in two locations: the navbar and the profile page.

## Running the Application
To run the application locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository-url]`
2. Navigate to the project folder: `cd [project-folder]`
3. Open file `profile.html`

Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference while reading the [article](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/observer-pattern-a-brief-introduction-cb733a13c87f) to gain a deeper understanding of the Observer pattern in action.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
